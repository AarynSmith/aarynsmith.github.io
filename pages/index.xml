I write primarily in Go and Python. I have been a self-starter since middle school when I taught myself Perl by reading the Perl Cookbook. I went on to learn JavaScript, C, C++, Ruby, Python, and most recently Go. I have worked with COBOL (yes that COBOL), Docker, Docker-Compose, Embedded Systems (ESP-32 and ESP8266).
I received my Bachelors in Science in Network Communications and Management, which led to a position with a small company as a network administrator.</description></item></channel></rss>
